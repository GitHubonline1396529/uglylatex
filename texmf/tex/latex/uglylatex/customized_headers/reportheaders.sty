% We use \relax in the false branch of \ifdefstring to ensure that LaTeX  
% does not encounter a missing argument error. The \ifdefstring macro  
% requires four parameters: (1) the tested string, (2) the target string, 
% (3) the code to execute if the strings match, and (4) the code to 
% execute if they do not match. If the false branch is omitted, LaTeX will
% fail with an error such as:  
%  
%     ! LaTeX Error: Missing \begin{document}.
%  
% This happens because \ifdefstring expects an explicit false branch, even
% if no action is required. Using \relax ensures LaTeX has a valid 
% fallback without introducing an empty group ({}) that might affect
% parsing.
