% Note that the `fontspec` is not loaded here since it requires XeLaTeX to
% compline the document. I hope that in English mode the user can compile
% the project directly using latex instead of xelatex while the document 
% is only written in lattin characters, so the `fontspec` package will be
% loaded dynamically according to the language mode chosen by the user.
% You can see `doclanguage.sty` for the detailed implement.
%
% Also, the `geometry` package is loaded in `docpapersize.sty` instead of 
% here.
