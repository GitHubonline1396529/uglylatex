% Package to setup abstract.
%
% note that for the document class `uglypaper', the `runin' option is
% required when importing the `abstract' package, but it is not required
% in the other two document classes `uglynite' and `uglyrep'. Therefore,
% the `abstract' package needs to be imported here, so that we can see 
% whether the `runin' option is used, rather than in the style file 
% `dependencies.sty`, which lists all the rest of the dependent packages.
